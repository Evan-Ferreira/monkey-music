On my old Samsung phone, I used to download mp3 files off of YouTube so I can listen to my favourite songs. However, ever since getting an iPhone I have been forced to purchase a Spotify subscription. However, my budget has gotten tighter so I created Monkey Music.

🙊 Monkey Music allows users to transfer their old Spotify playlist at the click of a button.

1. 📝 Copy and paste the link to your Spotify Playlist and press "transfer"
2. 🎶 Now you have all of your songs downloaded (completely offline!) on your iPhone
